# Blended Classroom
*A BRPS Sub‑Project Advancing the Future of Instruction at City Tech*

The **Blended Classroom** initiative reframes teaching and learning not by the physical location of students (in‑person, online, hybrid, HyFlex) but by **how learning is mediated across physical, virtual, and conceptual spaces**. In this model:

- Presence is not tied to place  
- Real‑time and delayed participation are equally valid  
- Human and AI systems **co‑mediate** learning instead of operating in a hierarchy  

The goal is not to add another modality — it is to **correct the premise** that modalities must be separate at all.

---
## Vision
The Blended Classroom establishes the learning environment as a **performance space for knowledge**, where humans, AI systems, and learning materials participate symmetrically and where instructional continuity persists across time and space.

---
## Relationship to CHI Meta‑Projects
The Blended Classroom is not a siloed effort — it is the synthesis point where **curriculum design**, **intelligent collaboration**, and **blended learning spaces** meet.

| Meta‑Project | Relationship |
|-------------|--------------|
| **META‑Curriculum** | Applies curriculum models that persist across time, space, and modality |
| **BRPS – Blended Reality Performance System** | Parent implementation system; the classroom as performance |
| **META‑Collaborative AI** | AI as co‑mediator of learning, supporting accessibility and continuity |
| **BBS – Balanced Blended Space** | Theoretical endpoint for symmetrical mediation across physical/virtual/conceptual spaces |
| **CHIIDS – CHI Integrated Digital System** | Communication and automation across distributed learning spaces |
| **BABS – Bioaware Blended Space** | Research on adaptive and responsive environments |
| **AVMI – Immersive Audio System** | Foundation for multichannel instructional sound environments |
| **Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre (BSP)** | Precedent for overlapping projection and spatial mediation of attention |

## Repository Purpose
This repository coordinates theory and deployment of the Blended Classroom model at City Tech, including:

- System architecture and mediation diagrams  
- Course‑level implementations and pilots  
- Research evidence and evaluation instruments  
- AI‑assisted learning tools, agents, and prototypes  
- Spatial and technological designs to support instruction  
- Integration frameworks across CHI Meta‑Projects

## Participation
Participation is open to faculty, student researchers (ESP / FWS / CHI Fellows / Independent Study), technical teams, and external collaborators.

To contribute:
1. Review `docs/` for conceptual grounding  
2. Open a **CHI Research Card** using the Issue Template  
3. Join an active strand or propose a new one aligned with BRPS/BBS  
4. Add work to a subfolder rather than altering core docs  

---
## Licensing
Documentation is expected to use **Creative Commons** licensing.  
Code components are expected to use a **permissive open‑source license** (MIT recommended).
