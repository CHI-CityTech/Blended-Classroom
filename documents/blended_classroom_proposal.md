## **Executive Summary**

Higher education still describes instruction using modality categories such as *face‑to‑face, hybrid, online synchronous, online asynchronous, HyFlex*, etc. These categories are **administrative artifacts**, not theoretical structures, and operate much like **Ptolemaic epicycles**—patchwork descriptors assembled to preserve a faulty assumption rather than to explain learning accurately.

Just as Ptolemy required separate rule systems, adjustments, and exceptions for each planet to preserve **“Earth at the center,”** higher education currentlyt requires separate systems, technologies, and policies for each “mode of delivery” to preserve the faulty axiom **“the physical classroom is the center of learning.”**

The **Blended Classroom** proposes the equivalent of a **Newtonian correction of the axiom.** Instead of defining instruction by physical location or time, it defines learning as a **mediated exchange of information among learners, instructors, and intelligent systems across conceptual, physical, and virtual spaces.** Once the axiom is corrected, what we currently call *in‑person, online synchronous, asynchronous, hybrid, HyFlex,* etc. become **natural special cases of a single model**, rather than separate institutional categories.

City Tech is uniquely positioned to lead this shift rather than follow it. The college’s identity—technology rooted in applied creativity and real‑world problem solving—aligns directly with the opportunity to define the next model of teaching and learning.

## **Introduction**

City Tech has always flourished when it defines its own future. The next strategic opportunity in higher education is not a new LMS platform or a new scheduling configuration—it is **the reframing of learning itself.** The central premise of the **Blended Classroom** is that learning must be defined not by *where* students sit or *when* they participate, but by **how knowledge is mediated between humans and intelligent systems.**

The vocabulary currently used in higher education—*hybrid, HyFlex, synchronous, asynchronous, in‑person*—describes logistics, not pedagogy. These modalities do not scale, because they are artifacts of an outdated assumption rather than expressions of a theory of learning.

## **Correcting the Faulty Axiom**

Higher education today functions on the inherited assumption that:

> **The physical classroom is the center of learning.**

Everything else—hybrid learning, online participation, HyFlex, asynchronous access—has been layered on top as an exception or workaround. As technology and student demands have evolved, we have attempted to preserve the axiom by adding increasingly complex wrappers, just as Ptolemy added epicycles to maintain the belief that planets orbit Earth.

This is why modality language cannot scale: **we are patching symptoms rather than correcting the premise.**

The **Blended Classroom** corrects the axiom:

> **Learning is the exchange of information across mediated pathways among learners, instructors, and intelligent systems.**

When mediation—not location—becomes the structural foundation, the complexity collapses. Multiple learning contexts become instances of the same model, not separate categories that require different systems, calendars, policies, and expectations.

## **What a Blended Classroom Is**

A Blended Classroom is defined not by where learning happens but by **how learning signals are mediated** across:

- **Physical space**
- **Virtual space**
- **Conceptual space**

In this model:

- Students in the room and students joining remotely participate symmetrically
- Real‑time and delayed participation are equally valid and equally supported
- AI becomes a **co‑mediator**, supporting summarization, note capture, concept linking, accessibility transformation, and adaptive scaffolding
- Presence is no longer tied to a chair—it is tied to **effective mediation**

## **Placement Within CHI and BRPS**

This initiative has a natural and immediate home within the existing **Center for Holistic Integration (CHI)** structure. The Blended Classroom represents a focused subset of the **Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS)**, where the classroom is understood as a **performance environment**—a space in which real‑time and latent interactions, physical and virtual presences, and human and AI intelligences orchestrate the flow of information.

- **BRPS – umbrella concept:** performance across blended physical/virtual spaces
- **Blended Classroom – pedagogical subset:** performance of learning
- **Balanced Blended Classroom – long‑term theoretical endpoint:** a fully formalized BBS application to pedagogy

This allows development to begin immediately without structural invention.

## **Strategic Value to the College**

The Blended Classroom strengthens City Tech across multiple priority areas:

- **Student success and persistence:** students cannot “fall out” of class because mediation continues across time and space
- **Equity and access:** students with work, family, or distance constraints receive a first‑class learning experience, not a secondary one
- **Recruitment and institutional identity:** City Tech becomes the place where the next model of learning is defined rather than adopted
- **Recruitment and institutional identity:** City Tech becomes the place where the next model of learning is defined rather than adopted
- **Strategic leadership in instructional technology and AI integration:** positions City Tech as the college pioneering the next national model of teaching and learning
- **Funding potential:** national funding agencies are prioritizing AI‑supported and blended learning innovation

This is not a technology initiative. It is an **intellectual and pedagogical repositioning** that aligns directly with City Tech’s strengths, including the opportunity for City Tech to take a **leadership role in instructional technology and the organic integration of AI** across teaching and learning.

## **Background & Expertise**

My work on the Blended Classroom is the latest step in a research arc spanning more than forty years. From the earliest explorations of the **Virtual Orchestra**, my focus has been on how humans and computational systems can collaborate across distance, time, and modality. Long before the vocabulary of *hybrid* or *remote* entered higher education, my work operated inside **blended environments**, combining physical performance with distributed computational mediation and demonstrating that a mediated interaction can preserve expressive intent across space and time.

As the research evolved—through immersive performance systems, collaborative machine intelligence, and intelligent environments—the core question expanded from *how systems perform with humans* to **how humans learn and grow when intelligent systems act as partners rather than tools**. The same ethical questions surfacing today in AI—replacement anxiety, authenticity, agency, and the role of human creativity—were the foundation of those debates. What that history taught me is that the goal is not to replace the human or privilege the machine, but to design **blended systems** in which the combination is more expressive and supportive than either alone.

That continuity extends into my pedagogical work. I have not only integrated emerging technologies into teaching, but have helped define City Tech’s academic landscape through the development of major degree programs—including **Emerging Media Technology**, **Business and Technology of Fashion**, **the AS in Health Science**, and the **BS in Health Care Policy and Management**. My roles on the **Online Learning Advisory Council**, as a **CUNY BBK Fellow**, and in authoring **OER in Ethical AI and immersive environments** reflect a sustained commitment to curriculum across modalities. The Blended Classroom is not a change of direction, but the **natural convergence** of four decades of research in mediated performance, collaborative AI, immersive systems, and multimodal pedagogy.

## **Conclusion****

The Blended Classroom gives City Tech the opportunity not to catch up to hybrid learning, but to **lead higher education beyond it.** It reframes the classroom not as a room but as a **mediated learning performance space**—a structure that supports students whether they are present physically, virtually, or later in time. It positions the college ahead of the curve at a moment when the national landscape is searching for direction.

Importantly, this proposal is **not to begin research**—that work is already underway across multiple CHI initiatives:
- The **Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science** course being delivered for **Modul University Vienna** in Spring is already operating as an early Blended Classroom implementation
- Research from the **AVMI DoD‑sponsored immersive audio project** has resulted in the first **fully immersive multichannel instructional space on campus**
- **Overlapping projection techniques** pioneered in the **Blended Shadow Puppet Theatre** have created a foundation for dynamic blended visual learning spaces
- **Bioaware Blended Space (BABS)** work is informing the design of **intelligent, responsive learning environments**
- **CHIIDS** is providing the communication architecture to support distributed activity and data flows across spaces and agents

These projects demonstrate that City Tech is **not proposing a speculative idea**, but rather **articulating and scaling an innovation that is already emerging organically from CHI research and from the college’s identity as a leader in applied media and technology.**

The Blended Classroom represents the next moment in that trajectory—one that has the potential to benefit students, elevate instructional excellence, and position City Tech as the institution where the future of higher education is not just anticipated, but **shaped.

**Respectfully,**\
